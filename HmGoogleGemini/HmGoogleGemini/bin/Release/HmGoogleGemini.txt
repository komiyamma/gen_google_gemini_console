## setTimeout in JavaScript

**setTimeout** is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to execute a function or a piece of code after a specified delay in milliseconds. It takes two arguments:

1. **Function to be executed:** This can be a named function, an anonymous function, or a string containing JavaScript code.
2. **Delay in milliseconds:** This is the number of milliseconds to wait before executing the function.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
let timeoutID = setTimeout(functionToExecute, delayInMilliseconds);
```

**Example:**

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello world!");
}

// Execute the sayHello function after 2 seconds
let timeoutID = setTimeout(sayHello, 2000);
```

This code will print "Hello world!" to the console after 2 seconds.

## Clearing Timeouts

You can cancel a scheduled timeout using the `clearTimeout` function. This function takes the timeout ID returned by `setTimeout` as its argument.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Clear the timeout after 1 second
clearTimeout(timeoutID);
```

**Additional Notes:**

* `setTimeout` is asynchronous, meaning that the code after the `setTimeout` call will continue to execute immediately, even though the function won't be executed until the specified delay has passed.
* You can use `clearTimeout` multiple times to clear multiple timeouts.
* Timeouts are not guaranteed to execute exactly after the specified delay, especially if the browser is busy doing other tasks.

## Use Cases for setTimeout

Here are some common use cases for `setTimeout`:

* Delaying the execution of code
* Creating animations
* Implementing timeouts for network requests
* Simulating user interactions
